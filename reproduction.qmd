Both the 2024 `r uni_name` open source survey and this Quarto analysis are open source. Instructions for customizing and reproducing this analysis are included here for ease of use.

## About the Survey

The 2024 open source survey at `r uni_name` was administered with Qualtrics. An anonymized CSV version of the Qualtrics output for this survey is available in the [data directory of this site's Github repository](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/tree/main/data).

### Exporting Survey Data From Qualtrics
Once your survey period is over, you can easily export your survey data. Within the Qualtrics project site for your survey, navigate to "Data and Analysis" $\rightarrow$ "Export & Import" $\rightarrow$ "Export Data..." and use the default settings in the options menu ("Download all fields" and "Use choice text") to export the survey response data as a CSV file.

## About the Quarto Site

This Quarto site uses the [UW-Madison Quarto Template](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/uw_quarto_site_template) to conform to UW-Madison brand guidelines. The template is easily customizable to incorporate the color schemes, logos, and typefaces of other institutions. 

Analysis of survey results is performed within R code chunks within the Quarto files for the appropriate pages. **Please note that the the analysis code written for this template is specific to the [format of the 2024 UW-Madison open source survey](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/tree/main/data)**. You will likely need to customize the code to adapt to the format of your survey's response data.

### Customizing the Site Theming

Most universities have a brand guidelines webpage that provides the color hex codes and typefaces that conform with the university's brand identity. [`custom.scss`](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/blob/main/custom.scss) contains the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) that styles all elements of the site that are not plots generated by R. You can customize the theme of the Quarto site here using your institution's brand's colors and typefaces. Custom fonts can be imported directly from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in `custom.scss` or downloaded and installed locally.

[`setup.R`](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/open_source_survey_results/blob/main/setup.R) is an R script that loads necessary packages and handles theming of R code output, like plots. Customize the sections of this script that define variables for your institution's name and color palette. The .qmd files that make up this Quarto site each `source` this file, so color variables, name, and plot themes customized in `setup.R` will apply to R output throughout the site.
