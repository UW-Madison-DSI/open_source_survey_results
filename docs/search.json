    "text": "Thanks to a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, The University of Wisconsin–Madison Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is positioned to support and grow our vibrant open source ecosystem. The OSPO’s mission is to collaborate with key stakeholders and community members to provide open source learning opportunities, promote best practices, facilitate the use of open source software in research, and make open source–fueled connections between practitioners and adopters on campus and beyond.\nIn Spring 2024, the OSPO distributed an open source survey to gauge the usage of open source tools among members of the university community, identify open source projects under development, and to collect feedback on improving the open source environment at UW-Madison. This site summarizes the findings of the results and allows users to explore how campus community members use open source tools at UW-Madison.\n\n\nView the results\n\n\nWe are open sourcing the survey itself (in Qualtrics format), an anonymized version of the responses, and this Quarto-based analysis of the survey results. Our goal is to streamline such surveys at other universities and encourage a uniform set of questions and responses that can more easily be aggregated to understand the broader open source ecosystem in academia. If you’re interested in recreating this survey and website for your institution please see the reproduction section.",

    "text": "About the Quarto Site\nThis Quarto site uses the UW-Madison Quarto Template to conform to UW-Madison brand guidelines. The template is easily customizable to incorporate the color schemes, logos, and typefaces of other institutions.\nAnalysis of survey results is performed within R code chunks within the Quarto files for the appropriate pages. Please note that the the analysis code written for this template is specific to the format of the 2024 UW-Madison open source survey. If you change the format of your survey you will likely need to customize the code to adapt to your survey’s response data.\n\nCustomizing the Site Theming\nMost universities have a brand guidelines webpage that provides the color hex codes and typefaces that conform with the university’s brand identity. custom.scss contains the SASS that styles all elements of the site that are not plots generated by R. You can customize the theme of the Quarto site here using your institutional brand’s colors and typefaces. Custom fonts can be imported directly from Google Fonts in custom.scss or downloaded and installed locally.\nsetup.R is an R script that loads necessary packages and handles theming of R code output, like plots. Customize the sections of this script that define variables for your institution’s name and color palette. The .qmd files that make up this Quarto site each source this file, so color variables, names, and plot themes customized in setup.R will apply to R output throughout the site.\nSome R chunks in the site qmd files, such as in usage.qmd, also contain vectors that you can edit to remove unwanted words or characters from free response field analyses or to highlight certain elements of plots.",
